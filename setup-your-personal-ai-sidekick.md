# Lab 3: Setup Your Personal AI Sidekick

Welcome to the AI Sidekick for Splunk hands-on lab! In this lab, you'll set up and run your own personal AI Sidekick for Splunk - a powerful, modular agent framework that integrates seamlessly with your Splunk environment.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this lab, you'll have:
- ✅ A fully functional AI Sidekick running on your machine
- ✅ Real-time connection to your Splunk environment via MCP
- ✅ Access to specialized AI agents including FlowPilot workflows
- ✅ A web interface to interact with your AI Sidekick
- ✅ Understanding of the modular agent architecture

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with command line/terminal
- Access to a Splunk instance (local or remote)
- Internet connection for downloading dependencies
- Administrator privileges on your machine (for installing Python packages)

---

## Step 1: Clone and Setup Repository

First, let's get the AI Sidekick project and switch to the workshop branch:

```bash
mkdir ~/dev1666
cd ~/dev1666
git clone https://github.com/deslicer/ai-sidekick-for-splunk.git
cd ai-sidekick-for-splunk
git checkout dev1666
```

> **💡 Important:** The `dev1666` branch has pre-configured `.env` file with all required environment variables for the workshop.

## Step 2: Install Prerequisites and Dependencies

Choose your operating system and run the appropriate prerequisite script:

### 🪟 Windows
```powershell
.\scripts\lab\check-prerequisites.ps1
```

### 🍎 macOS
```bash
./scripts/lab/check-prerequisites.sh
```

### 🐧 Linux
```bash
./scripts/lab/check-prerequisites.sh
```

### 🐍 Cross-Platform (Python)
If you already have Python 3.11+ installed:
```bash
python scripts/check-prerequisites.py
```

<details>
<summary>📋 What the prerequisite scripts do</summary>

The scripts will:
- ✅ Check for Python 3.11+ and install if needed
- ✅ Install `uv` (fast Python package manager)
- ✅ Create Python virtual environment using `uv`
- ✅ Install all project dependencies
- ✅ Verify Git installation
- ✅ Prepare your system for AI Sidekick

**Expected output:**
```
[SUCCESS] ✅ Python 3.11+ is installed
[SUCCESS] ✅ uv is installed and ready
[SUCCESS] ✅ Git is installed
[SUCCESS] ✅ Virtual environment created successfully
[SUCCESS] ✅ Dependencies installed successfully

Next Steps:
1. Activate Python environment: source .venv/bin/activate (macOS/Linux) or .venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
2. Start AI Sidekick: uv run ai-sidekick --start
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>🛠️ Manual Installation (Fallback)</summary>

If the prerequisite scripts don't work for your system:

**Install Python 3.11+:**
- **Windows:** Download from [python.org](https://python.org)
- **macOS:** `brew install python@3.11` or download from [python.org](https://python.org)
- **Linux:** `sudo apt install python3.11` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo yum install python3.11` (RHEL/CentOS)

**Install uv:**
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Create virtual environment and install dependencies:**
```bash
uv venv
uv sync
```
</details>

---

## Step 3: Activate Environment and Start AI Sidekick

### Activate the Python environment:

**Windows:**
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Start the AI Sidekick:
```bash
uv sync
uv run ai-sidekick --start
```

You should see output like:
```
🚀 AI Sidekick Setup Complete!

✅ Virtual environment activated
✅ Google ADK initialized
✅ MCP server connection verified
✅ AI agent ready

🌐 Web interface available at: http://localhost:8087

Opening web interface in your browser...
```

## Step 4: Meet Your AI Sidekick

### Understanding the Agent Architecture

Your AI Sidekick uses a **modular multi-agent architecture** with these specialized agents:

1. **🎯 Root Agent** - Main coordinator and conversation handler
2. **🔍 Search Guru** - SPL expert for search optimization and strategy
3. **🔬 Data Explorer** - Comprehensive data analysis with 5-phase workflow
4. **🧠 Researcher** - Google Search integration for current information
5. **🔧 Splunk MCP** - Direct Splunk environment access and execution
6. **⚡ FlowPilot Workflows** - Template-driven specialized workflows

### Agent Selection

1. **In the web interface**, locate the **Agent Selection** dropdown in the top left
2. **Select "AI Sidekick for Splunk"** from the dropdown
3. The framework will automatically route your requests to the appropriate specialized agents

---

## Step 5: Try Your AI Sidekick

Let's test your AI Sidekick with three essential workflows:

### Example 1: System Health Check 🏥

**You:** 
```bash
Run a system health check
```

<details>
<summary>Expected Response</summary>

The AI Sidekick will:
- Automatically delegate to the **System Health Check Flow** (FlowPilot workflow)
- Check Splunk connectivity and version
- Verify data ingestion (last 24 hours)
- Assess basic system performance
- Provide health recommendations and educational insights

**Sample Output:**
```
✅ System Health Check Complete

📊 System Overview:
- Splunk Version: 9.4.0 (Build: abc123)
- System Status: Healthy
- Data Flow: Active (1.2M events/24h)

🎯 Health Assessment:
- ✅ Splunk services running normally
- ✅ Data ingestion active
- ⚠️  Consider index optimization for better performance

📚 Educational Insights:
This health check verified your Splunk environment is ready for workshop activities.
```
</details>

### Example 2: List Available Indexes 📋

**You:** 
```bash
List all available indexes
```

<details>
<summary>Expected Response</summary>

The Splunk MCP agent will:
- Connect to your Splunk environment
- Retrieve all available indexes
- Show data volume and last update information
- Provide index usage recommendations

**Sample Output:**
```
📋 Available Splunk Indexes:

🔍 Core Indexes:
- main (2.1GB, last event: 2 minutes ago)
- _internal (890MB, last event: 30 seconds ago)
- _audit (45MB, last event: 1 minute ago)

🏢 Workshop Indexes:
- pas (1.5GB, last event: 5 minutes ago)
- security (780MB, last event: 3 minutes ago)

💡 Recommendation: Use 'pas' index for analysis exercises - it has rich sample data perfect for learning.
```
</details>

### Example 3: Index Analysis Flow 🔬

**You:** 
```bash
Use index analysis flow to analyze index=s4c_www and provide actionable insights
```

<details>
<summary>Expected Response</summary>

The **Index Analysis Flow** (FlowPilot workflow) will execute a comprehensive analysis:

**Phase 1: Data Collection** - Gather basic index information and samples
**Phase 2: Field Analysis** - Analyze field patterns and distributions  
**Phase 3: Pattern Recognition** - Identify trends and anomalies
**Phase 4: Volume Assessment** - Evaluate data volume and performance
**Phase 5: Insight Generation** - Generate actionable business insights

**Sample Output:**
```
🔬 Index Analysis Complete: s4c_www

📊 Analysis Summary:
- Total Events: 2,456,789 events
- Time Range: 30 days
