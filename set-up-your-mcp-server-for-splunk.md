***Choose your path***

For this guide, "Beginner" means you don‚Äôt have Git or a code editor installed and you‚Äôre not comfortable using the terminal/PowerShell yet.

- If you're a beginner: go to [Beginners Setup](docs/mcp/BEGINNERS_SETUP.md)
- If you need to install prerequisites on your OS: go to [Windows](docs/mcp/WINDOWS_GUIDE.md), [macOS](docs/mcp/MACOS_GUIDE.md), or [Linux](docs/mcp/LINUX_GUIDE.md)
- If you already have all prerequisites installed: jump to [Clone GitHub Repository](#clone-repo)

### Clone GitHub Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deslicer/mcp-for-splunk.git
cd mcp-for-splunk
# Checkout dev1666 branch in git, this branch has a prepared .env file for you.
git checkout dev1666
```

## 2. Prepare your environment

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ and UV package manager
- Splunk test instance will be provided to you by email, let the instructor know if you haven't received an email.

### Sync project dependencies

Run this first to install all project dependencies as defined by the lockfile. Syncing ensures everything is up-to-date before you start the server.

```bash
uv sync
```

### Run the MCP server

#### Option 1 - Local Service - Recommended

```bash
# Start the uv application using command line
# Linux/MacOS
./scripts/build_and_run.sh --local

# Windows PowerShell
.\scripts\build_and_run.ps1 --local

# Windows (CMD)
.\scripts\build_and_run.bat --local
```

#### Option 2 - Docker Solution - Optional

```bash
# Ensure that Docker Desktop is started on your laptop
docker ps
# Download and build the MCP server using Docker
# Linux/MacOS
./scripts/build_and_run.sh --docker
# To stop the containers
./scripts/build_and_run.sh --stop

# Windows PowerShell
.\scripts\build_and_run.ps1 --docker

# Windows (CMD)
.\scripts\build_and_run.bat --docker
```

### Verify the MCP server

You can verify in one of two ways:

- Using MCP Inspector: follow the sections below:
  - Part 1 - Verification - Local Service
  - Verification - Docker Solution (for Docker)
- Run the automated test script:

#### Automated test script
```bash
uv run python scripts/test_setup.py
```

Expected output:

```text
