## Overview

This workshop is designed to help you understand how to connect AI with your Splunk Enterprise environment. You'll learn to build AI agents using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and create intelligent sidekicks that can interact with your Splunk data.

## Lab Connection Info

You will be receiving instructions from Splunk about Splunk Show environment details. If you do not receive these details, please let one of the instructors know and we will fix it. Alternatively, we provide instructions to run Splunk in your local Docker environment for those who prefer a local setup.
