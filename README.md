### Lab 1: Set up MCP Server for Data Analytics

**Description:**
In this lab you will set up your own MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for data analytics, which serves as the bridge between AI agents and your data analytics environment.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- Understand MCP architecture and its role in AI-data integration
- Configure and deploy MCP server for data analytics
- Verify connectivity and test server functionality

**Steps:**
1. **Clone the repository and prepare environment:**

   **macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/dev1666
   cd ~/dev1666
   git clone https://github.com/deslicer/mcp-for-splunk.git
   cd mcp-for-splunk
   git checkout dev1666
   unset UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT
   ```

   **Windows:**
   ```powershell
   mkdir $HOME\dev1666
   cd $HOME\dev1666
   git clone https://github.com/deslicer/mcp-for-splunk.git
   cd mcp-for-splunk
   git checkout dev1666
   ```

2. **Copy the lab environment configuration:**

   **macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   cp env.lab .env
   ```

   **Windows:**
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item env.lab .env -Force
   ```

3. **Install prerequisites using the smart install script:**

   **macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/smart-install.sh
   ```

   **Windows:**
   ```powershell
   pwsh -File scripts\smart-install.ps1
   ```

‚ö†Ô∏è After completing the smart-install you need to provide splunk connection details. You should have received an email with details to a Splunk Show instance. Ensure you have access to the Splunk host, port, username and password before continuing to the next step. If you are lacking that information, reach out to one of the speakers.
   ```
   Host:
   Port:
   Username:
   Password: (No echo prompt)
   ```

4. **Start the MCP server and verify it's running:**
   ```bash
   uv run mcp-server --local -d
   ```

5. **Test the MCP server and data analytics connection:**
   ```bash
   uv run mcp-server --test
   ```

**Expected Output:**
```
== MCP Server Check ==
URL: http://0.0.0.0:8003/mcp/
‚Ä¢ MCP Server: OK ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ Tools: 39 | Resources: 17

-- Data Analytics Health --
‚Ä¢ Status: Connected ‚úÖ
‚Ä¢ Server: splunk-server-name
‚Ä¢ Version: 9.3.2411.113
‚Ä¢ Source: server_config
```

**Lab completion verification:**
- If the script returns "MCP Server: OK ‚úÖ" and "Data Analytics Health Status: Connected ‚úÖ", you have successfully completed the setup lab.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- Deploy the AI Sidekick multi-agent framework
- Understand specialized agent roles and capabilities
- Experience automated workflow execution

**Steps:**

6. **Clone and setup AI Sidekick repository:**

   **macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/dev1666
   cd ~/dev1666
   git clone https://github.com/deslicer/ai-sidekick-for-splunk.git
   cd ai-sidekick-for-splunk
   git checkout dev1666
   unset UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT
   ```

   **Windows:**
   ```powershell
   mkdir $HOME\dev1666
   cd $HOME\dev1666
   git clone https://github.com/deslicer/ai-sidekick-for-splunk.git
   cd ai-sidekick-for-splunk
   git checkout dev1666
   ```

7. **Run the smart-install script:**

   **macOS/Linux:**
   ```bash
   unset UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT
   ./scripts/smart-install.sh
   ```

   **Windows:**
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\smart-install.ps1
   ```

8. **AI Sidekick:**

‚ö†Ô∏è After completing the smart-install you need to provide splunk connection details. You should have received an email with details to a Splunk Show instance. Ensure you have access to the Splunk host, port, username and password before continuing to the next step. If you are lacking that information, reach out to one of the speakers.
