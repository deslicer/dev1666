## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**üî¥ "Connection to Splunk failed"**
- Verify Splunk is running and accessible
- Check firewall settings allow port 8089
- Confirm username/password are correct
- Try disabling SSL verification for self-signed certificates

**üî¥ "MCP Server not responding"**
The setup script will automatically check if the MCP server is running and provide clear instructions if it's not. If you see this error:

1. **üö® IMPORTANT: Start the MCP server first!**

   The AI Sidekick requires the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to communicate with Splunk.

   **üìã Easy Setup - Use the build script:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to MCP server directory
   cd ../mcp-server-for-splunk

   # Run the automated build and run script
   ./scripts/build_and_run.sh
   ```

   **üìñ For detailed MCP server setup, refer to the lab guide in the MCP project.**

   **üîß Manual Setup (if build script fails):**

   #### For macOS/Linux/Unix:
   ```bash
   cd ../mcp-server-for-splunk
   uv run fastmcp run src/server.py --transport http --port 8001
   ```

   #### For Windows:
   ```powershell
   cd ..\mcp-server-for-splunk
   uv run fastmcp run src/server.py --transport http --port 8001
   ```

   **üê≥ Docker Alternative (Recommended if remote Splunk fails):**

   If you're having issues with remote Splunk connections, refer to the **MCP server lab guide** for detailed Docker setup instructions with local Splunk instance.

2. **‚úÖ Verify MCP server is running:**
   - **Local setup:** You should see: `INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8001`
   - **Docker setup:** Check containers: `docker-compose ps`
   - Test connection: `curl http://localhost:8001/health`

3. **üîç Test MCP server tools (Optional but recommended):**

   Use MCP Inspector to verify your MCP server tools are working:

   ```bash
   # In a new terminal, navigate to MCP server directory
   cd ../mcp-server-for-splunk

   # Run MCP Inspector
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector http://localhost:8001/mcp/
   ```

   This opens a web interface where you can:
   - ‚úÖ See all available MCP tools
   - ‚úÖ Test tool execution with sample queries
   - ‚úÖ Verify Splunk connectivity
   - ‚úÖ Debug any connection issues

4. **Then re-run the AI Sidekick setup script**
5. **Verify no other services are using port 8001**

**üî¥ "Web interface won't load"**
- Confirm port 8087 is not blocked or in use
- Try accessing `http://127.0.0.1:8087` instead
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Run ADK web interface manually:

  #### For macOS/Linux/Unix:
  ```bash
  cd ai-sidekick-for-splunk
  source .venv/bin/activate
  cd src
  adk web --port 8087
  ```

  #### For Windows:
  ```powershell
  cd ai-sidekick-for-splunk
  .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  cd src
  adk web --port 8087
  ```

**üî¥ "Python virtual environment issues"**
- Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed
- Delete `.venv` folder and re-run setup script
- On Windows, try running PowerShell as Administrator

**üî¥ "Agent responses are slow"**
- Check your internet connection (for Google Search features)
- Verify Splunk server performance
- Consider using local Splunk instance for faster responses

**üî¥ "API key errors"**
- Ensure you have a valid Google API key configured
- Check that the key has appropriate permissions
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
